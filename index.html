    <p id="p2">
 Happy Birthday my bestie!!. I hope your day goes 
 amazing! So, as you know, because of all this "CORONA" 
 thingie :/, I cannot give you a gift physically! That 
 means I had to make something that could be gifted online.
 So, I thought that through my coding skills, I can make 
 a game, especially for you as your birthday gift! ;)
    </p>

    <p id="p3">
 It took me a lot of time to make this game but luckily
 it turned out just like how i wanted it to be.! I hope
 you would like! *fingers crossed*! But before you start playing
 I wanna tell you a how everything was planned, in short 
 :D.
    </p>

    <p id="p4">
 So, basically, I began making this game on 13 of May, 9
 days before your birthday. I was literally, so excited to
 make something like this because it was the first time
 I would make a game for one of my friends :D! Just 2 days
 before your birthday, I gave the game link to everyone in
 our "gang" XD! We did a meeting and I asked them to play
 the game one by one and tell me if something is missing 
 or is there something I should fix or add. Then,after all
 of fixing, adding etc., I finally was done with the game.
 On your birthday morning, I gave the final game link to 
 everyone so that they could see and play the game which
 was about to be gifted to u!!!
    </p>

    <p id="p5">
 And then finally, I wrote this document and gave you this
 document's link! :D I hope this was a fun little story ;D
    </p>

    <form id="f1">
 Now, let me tell you the game controls -:
    </form>

    <form id="f2">
 1. Press 's' to load the game.
    </form>

    <form id="f3">
 2. Press 'space bar' to start the game. 
    </form>

    <form id="f4">
 3. Use the 'left arrow' to move to the left side.
    </form>

    <form id="f5">
 4. Use the 'Right arrow' to move to the right side.
    </form>

    <p id="p6">
 I hope you would enjoy the game as much as I enjoyed
 making it! This is the link, copy it and paste it in the
